Please read the "Introduction to Each Command" section in README.md and determine if all the `.md` files in the commands directory (each `.md` file represents *a claude code command*) have been introduced. **If not, you need to add the commands that have not yet been added to the markdown table in README.md under "Introduction to Each Command".** The table columns should include: Command Name, Language, and Function Description.
